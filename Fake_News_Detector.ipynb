In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans,  U.S. Representative Mark Meadows,  speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation, ” drew a hard line on federal spending,  which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday,  lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues,  such as immigration policy,  even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending,  while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education,  scientific research,  infrastructure,  public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent, ’” Meadows,  chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus,  said on the program. “Now,  Democrats are saying that’s not enough,  we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative,  I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money, ” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul,  which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility, ” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion,  to be paid off by future generations,  to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many,  many years to come, ” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package,  the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,   will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan,  who also supported the tax bill,  recently went further than Meadows,  making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform, ” as the party often calls it,  would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance,  “entitlement” programs mean food stamps,  housing assistance,  Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly,  poor and disabled,  as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks,  saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate,  where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate,  which Republicans narrowly control,  to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending,  while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers, ” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  or DACA,  program,  which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives,  such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean, ” she said.  On Wednesday,  Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7,  the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott,  who wants more emergency aid.

Two federal appeals courts,  one in Washington and one in Virginia,  last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs,  the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime, ” the official said,  speaking on condition of anonymity. In September,  the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court,  but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order,  the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi,  a lawyer with gay,  lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD,  called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country, ” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters,  Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military,  reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore,  Washington,  D.C.,  Seattle and Riverside,  California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1,  2017,  to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary,  James Mattis,  postponed that date to Jan. 1,  2018,  which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October,  his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees,  reversing another Obama-era position. In February,  Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. \", politicsNews, \"December 29,  2017 \", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

Lindsey Graham,  who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees,  said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence, ” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election,  and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort,  has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power,  despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating,  as well as Mueller,  whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign,  and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy,  Christopher Steele,  which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday,  the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe,  but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it,  and I want somebody to look at it, ” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact,  it would hurt us if we ignored it, ” he said. \", politicsNews, \"December 31,  2017 \", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat,  Alexander Downer,  in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign,  the Times reported. Two months after the meeting,  Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online,  according to the newspaper,  which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians,  the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments,  including the British and Dutch,  the Times said. Papadopoulos,  a Chicago-based international energy lawyer,  pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role,  saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times,  however,  reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation,  which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller,  has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney,  Ty Cobb,  declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process,  we are not commenting on matters such as this, ” he said in a statement.

Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service,  which runs at a big loss,  is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses,  according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission,  an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos,  who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world,  according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post,  a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year,  Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax,  which is not true,  and so hurts other retailers,  part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives,  a research analyst at GBH Insights,  said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However,  he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However,  that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively, ” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service,  including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015,  the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping,  46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1, 175.90 by early afternoon. Overall,  U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel,  president of ShipMatrix Inc,  which analyzes shipping data,  disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N),  the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services,  he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages,  for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season,  Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys,  from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS,  at 21 percent,  and FedEx is third,  with 8 percent or so,  according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce,  which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut,  a spokesman for UPS,  noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service,  but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon,  the White House,  the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report,  the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year,  and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail,  marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining,  revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30,  2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February,  the service is facing growing personnel expenses,  particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law,  the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. \", politicsNews, \"December 29,  2017 \")</th>\n",

Robert  LaVoy  Finicum and his wife Jeanette have fostered more than 50 boys over the last decade at their ranch near Chino Valley,  Arizona. The couple is licensed and has a care contract with the Catholic Charities Community Services. Many of the children came from mental hospitals,  drug rehabs and group homes for emotionally distressed youth,  he told Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). IMAGE: Robert  LaVoy  Finicum. My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,   Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good. He traveled to Oregon to take part in the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge at the beginning of January,  leaving Jeanette to care for the four boys. But now the Finicums have no more fosters to care for.A social worker began removing the last four of the family s foster kids on January 4,  the fourth day of the Oregon standoff. The last left five days later,  he said. They didn t go out at the same time,   Finicum said.  One was there for a year,  one of the boys was there six months,  another eight months,  and a month. I don t know where they ended up. He blamed the kids  removals on pressure from the feds. They were ripped from my wife,   Finicum said.  We are very successful [foster parents]. Our track records are good,  it s been a good relationship. [Federal authorities] must have gotten to the governor,  who told the state to get them out of there.

The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports,  the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well,  enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings,  and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism,  Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries,  but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,   said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain,  only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,   sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention,  boarding,  or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

Whenever there is a dispute or a change of law,  and two tribes go to war,  there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation  the lawyers. Ars TechnicaIn late 2013,  Yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of e-mail to produce targeted ads. The cases,  which were consolidated in federal court,  all argued that the privacy rights of non-Yahoo users,  who  did not consent to Yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails,   were being violated by a multi-billion dollar company.Now,  lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune. Last week,  they asked US District Judge Lucy Koh to accept a proposed settlement (PDF). Under the proposal,  the massive class of non-Yahoo users won t get any payment,  but the class lawyers at Girard Gibbs and Kaplan Fox intend to ask for up to $4 million in fees. (The ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge,  but Yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to $4 million.)While users won t get any payment,  Yahoo will change how it handles user e-mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for. Yahoo won t stop scanning e-mails. Instead,  the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e-mails. In the settlement (PDF),  Yahoo has agreed that e-mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a Yahoo Mail user can access the email in his or her inbox. The settlement deal looks pretty similar to what Yahoo had argued it did in the first place Continue this story at Ars TechnicaREAD MORE NSA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NSA Files\", Middle-east, \"January 16,  2016\", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

In fact,  US Military Central Command (CENTCOM) for the Middle East region is located in Qatar s capital of Doha,  conveniently located just down the road from Al Jazeera s headquarters. Nice and cozy.Al Jazeera s role in promoting  regime change  and the destablization of Syria is now recorded history,  as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakery.The Qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into North America,  but no matter how much money they threw at it (and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work),  no one cared about it,  much less watched it. I know this will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future. The decision that has been made is in no way because AJAM has done anything but a great job,   reads a company email from CEO Al Anstey,  obtained by Politico.Indeed,  they tried everything it seems,  just short of paying Americans to watch their programs Al Jazeera America to close down https://t.co/EmFjBw9uC1 pic.twitter.com/HDea8ujTPt  Al Jazeera America (@ajam) January 13,  2016In 2012,  the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera purchased Current TV from Al Gore for an inflated $500 million. Wait,  it gets worse MONEY FOR NOTHING: Gore got fat off the AJAM deal.In addition to the $500 million which Doha blew on buying Gore s lemon,  Current TV,  the Qataris have spent at least $50 million per year between 2012   2015,  along with many millions spent on advertising AJAM on other network slots,  online ads,  along with billboards and print media promotions. This was the Qataris   easy  ticket on to US cable and satellite networks. Boy,  did Gore pull a fast one there.  In total,  you would be looking at $700 million for the whole party. At its apex,  AJAM would be lucky to pull in 30, 000 viewers during prime time   which really amounts to a  nothing  market share.With all that money,  and considering the hundreds of staff and  media executives  and producers they employed,  it s safe to say that someone(s) did not have a clue what they were doing.What a colossal joke.On the bright side,  the Qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda mills.READ MORE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EPIC FAILS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch\", Middle-east, \"January 14,  2016\", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans', ' U.S. Representative Mark Meadows', ' speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation', '” drew a hard line on federal spending', ' which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday', ' lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues', ' such as immigration policy', ' even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending', ' while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education', ' scientific research', ' infrastructure', ' public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent', '’” Meadows', ' chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus', ' said on the program. “Now', ' Democrats are saying that’s not enough', ' we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative', ' I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money', '” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul', ' which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility', '” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion', ' to be paid off by future generations', ' to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives.

              "      <th>(U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon, \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts,  the Pentagon said on Friday,  after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts,  one in Washington and one in Virginia,  last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs,  the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime, ” the official said,  speaking on condition of anonymity. In September,  the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court,  but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order,  the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi,  a lawyer with gay,  lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD,  called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country, ” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters,  Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military,  reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore,  Washington,  D.C.,  Seattle and Riverside,  California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1,  2017,  to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary,  James Mattis,  postponed that date to Jan. 1,  2018,  which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October,  his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees,  reversing another Obama-era position. In February,  Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. \", politicsNews, \"December 29,  2017 \", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

Lindsey Graham,  who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees,  said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence, ” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election,  and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort,  has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power,  despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating,  as well as Mueller,  whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign,  and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy,  Christopher Steele,  which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday,  the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe,  but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it,  and I want somebody to look at it, ” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact,  it would hurt us if we ignored it, ” he said. \", politicsNews, \"December 31,  2017 \", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat,  Alexander Downer,  in London was a driving factor behind the FBI’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow’s contacts with the Trump campaign,  the Times reported. Two months after the meeting,  Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online,  according to the newspaper,  which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians,  the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments,  including the British and Dutch,  the Times said. Papadopoulos,  a Chicago-based international energy lawyer,  pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide’s campaign role,  saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times,  however,  reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation,  which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller,  has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller’s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Trump’s White House attorney,  Ty Cobb,  declined to comment on the New York Times report. “Out of respect for the special counsel and his process,  we are not commenting on matters such as this, ” he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates,  including Papadopoulos,  in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow. \", politicsNews, \"December 30,  2017 \", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

              "      <th>(Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments, \"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O),  picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office,  which is losing many billions of dollars a year,  while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages,  making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service,  which runs at a big loss,  is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses,  according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission,  an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos,  who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world,  according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post,  a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year,  Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax,  which is not true,  and so hurts other retailers,  part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives,  a research analyst at GBH Insights,  said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However,  he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However,  that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively, ” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service,  including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015,  the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping,  46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1, 175.90 by early afternoon. Overall,  U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel,  president of ShipMatrix Inc,  which analyzes shipping data,  disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N),  the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services,  he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages,  for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season,  Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys,  from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS,  at 21 percent,  and FedEx is third,  with 8 percent or so,  according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce,  which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut,  a spokesman for UPS,  noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service,  but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon,  the White House,  the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report,  the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year,  and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail,  marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining,  revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30,  2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February,  the service is facing growing personnel expenses,  particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law,  the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. \", politicsNews, \"December 29,  2017 \")</th>\n",

The Republican front-runner has been openly condoning violence at his rallies,  going so far as to say he would even pay the legal fees of those going after protesters.Then there s the issue of Trump s utter racism which is obvious and abhorrent. He s consistently going after minority groups,  blaming them for all the nation s problems,  and somehow Trump and his overwhelmingly white group of supporters are apparently the ones who are being oppressed. This is literally reminiscent of another fascist ideologue from Europe in the 1930s and 40s.And of course,  Trump s son,  Donald Trump Jr.,  is defending his father the whole way   and completely cementing the fact that they believe the aggression is against them and not the other way around. However,  the brilliant and talented John Legend took a moment to step in and school them on what is actually going on..@DonaldJTrumpJr I think they were protesting your racist father. This isn't complicated.  John Legend (@johnlegend) March 12,  2016But of course,  some jackass decides to just blindly call Legend uneducated because he had the audacity to disagree with Trump and Trump Junior,  so the Grammy Award winner tweets out a very interesting and funny fact..@DanielT03571138 @DonaldJTrumpJr the Donalds and I graduated from the same University,  funny enough.  John Legend (@johnlegend) March 12,  2016Legend then drives the point home,  after what can only be assumed hundreds of tweet replies telling him that he is really the racist,  by posting an article about how Donald Trump turned away people of color. Thus exposing who the true racist is. Yes,  Trump trolls. I'm the real racist. https://t.co/xzgMsEPeh4  John Legend (@johnlegend) March 12,  2016Racism is alive and well in America,  in particular among those supporting Donald Trump. And this racism isn t new,  it hasn t been brought about by anyone,  it never went away,  but rather into hiding. However,  with people like Donald Trump openly spewing his racist rhetoric at any chance he can get,  it opened the floodgates for racists everywhere to feel that behavior is now somehow acceptable.But guess what? We are in the year 2016,  and racism will be called out. This isn t an infringement on any constitutional right. In fact,  it is the right of the protesters to openly dissent and condemn racism where it stands.Featured image via Instagram/Instagram/Twitter\", News, \"March 12,  2016\", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

The assembled gang could barely contain their glee at the prospect of damning testimony from James Comey. That all set the stage for a typical Mika Brzezinski tirade that was honestly one of the most disgusting assaults on President Trump yet. It s unhinged hate!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZoUCHs22Aw I think Trump is such a narcissist,  it s possible he is mentally ill in a way and this is on the table,  I said it months ago and now everyone is starting to say it like it s new,  and it s ok to say. He s not well,   she said.  At the very least,  he s not well. And he s so narcissistic he does not believe the rules apply to him,  and that s where the ignorance label may apply because this is a man who says he can grab women anywhere because he s famous. Then something very curious happened.Scarborough looked off camera and can be heard saying,   What s that? Wow,   Then Willie Geist showed him something and the two started laughing. Then a clearly not listening Scarborough,  banged the table. Stop right there,   he laughed  I need an eject button. He posted it?  Scarborough appeared to ask someone else?Brzezinski finally realized that nobody was listening to her and demanded an explanation. Nothing I have said is crazy,   she said. We ll talk about it in the break,   said Scarborough barely able to get it out through his own laugher.The show soon went to break. When it returned Scarborough joked about  keeping it in the guard rails. Brzezinski appeared to offer an explanation of her actions.  I am keeping it in the guard rails. Everything I ve said you all have thought and you know and you ve said in your own way. You re going to talk to me about a filter?  she snapped at Scarborough.\", politics, \"Jun 30,  2017\", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",

Photos of McCabe campaigning for his wife raised questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Special Counsel for violating The Hatch Act that prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races.The Office of U.S. Special Counsel,  the government s main whistleblower agency,  is investigating whether FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe s activities supporting his wife Jill s Democratic campaign for Virginia state senate in 2015 violated the Hatch Act s prohibition against FBI agents campaigning in partisan races. I am voting for Jill because she is the best wife ever,   McCabe put on a sign that he photographed himself holding. The photo was posted on her social media page a few days before the election,  in response to Dr. Jill McCabe s plea to  help me win  by posting photos expressing reasons why voters should vote for her,  according to the complaint.Other social media photos in the complaint showed McCabe s minor daughter campaigning with her mother,  wearing an FBI shirt,  and McCabe voting with his wife at a polling station.Here is another social media photo of our acting #FBI director,  #AndrewMcCabe breaking the rules by campaigning on social media. #Corrupt pic.twitter.com/hBCH29yErY  Senator Dick Black (@SenRichardBlack) May 9,  2017The Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging  in political activity in concert with a political party,  a candidate for partisan political office,  or a partisan political group. It defines prohibited political activity as  any activity directed at the success or failure of a partisan group or candidate in a partisan election. An ethics expert told Circa the photos raised legitimate questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Meanwhile,  Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe s office released to Circa under the Freedom of Information Act documents showing McCabe attended a meeting with his wife and the governor on a Saturday in March 2015 specifically to discuss having Jill McCabe run for state Senate in Virginia as a Democrat. This is a candidate recruitment meeting. McCabe is seriously considering running against State Senator Dick Black. You have been asked to close the deal,   the briefing memo for McAuliffe read.Watch Sean Hannity discuss McCabe s involvement in his wife s campaign as well as his ties to Hillary s campaign:Included in the governor s briefing package was a copy of McCabe s FBI biography. The biography made clear that Andrew McCabe was a senior executive who at the time oversaw the FBI s Washington field office that among many tasks supervised investigations in northern Virginia.At the time of the meeting,  published reports indicate agents in the Washington field office were involved in both a probe of McAuliffe and of the governor s close friend,  Hillary Clinton s and her private email account.h/t Gateway Pundit\", politics, \"Jun 28,  2017\", nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan)</th>\n",
